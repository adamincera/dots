Menhir tests:

To run:
python tests.py

Runs all tests in all .txt files in directory menhir-tests. Each test is a sequence of tokens.

No flags: 
default configuration. Only prints tests that failed.

-e:
Show menhir's stderr warnings and messages.

-f:
Print full syntax tree and menhir output.

Order doesn't matter for flags.


Adding tests:
Testing script will ignore lines that begin with newline or lines that begin with ***, which denotes a comment. Lines that begin with f** are expected to fail, and if they pass, print an appropriate error message. Add sequences of tokens to .txt files, or add additional .txt files. 

Other tests:
before running runtest.py,

pip install -r requirements.txt
